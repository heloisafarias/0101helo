            When I was a kid, my parents didn't have money to buy me a computer. But, for my luck,
             my uncle had one. So when I came home from class, I would get my bike and 
             go to my grandma's house.
            I learned everything I knew about computers all by myself.

            I remember I spent a lot of time at Orkut, a dead social media. 
            I used to write on forums about Harry Potter, bands I like or games. 
            This Social Media even had minigames! I used to love them.

          After years making blogs, one day during a conversation with my boyfriend I stopped, saying: 
          I wish I could make some money with those websites.
   And he told me: Well, you can, it's actually a profession. And it's called Web Developer. </h1>

      Since this day I started looking for courses at the internet, and learned a lot about HTML and CSS.
    My biggest dream was to enter a college, study programming and learn more about technology.
     This year, I finally started studying in an awesome university and met a lot
of cool people who also love programming. I still don't work with IT but everyday I love this area 
more and more. Now it's more than just a hobbie, it's my life and future. 
I'm really happy and I've been looking for more knowledge. I used to want to be a Doctor, and studied a lot.
 But never got into school. It was so frustrating I thought I should quit life. 
 But I always believed something good would come for me. I think I'm really close now. 
A lot of times I used to think about giving up. There was tears, anger, frustration. But now, I'm really proud of how far I've come. 
May the odds be ever in my favor.
